**DeepLabCut --> MotionMapper**

(1) download the code from Gordon Berman; here is a lightly modified version that I forked
that I know works with the script I supply: https://github.com/MMathisLab/MotionMapper

(2) Make sure the whole folder is on-path in MATLAB (see Gordon's instrustions too) 

(3) Place my two helper functions into the MotionMapper folder: https://github.com/AlexEMG/DLCutils/tree/master/DLC_2_MotionMapper

(4) Open the .m file called deeplabcut_into_motionMapper.m and follow the instructions!
